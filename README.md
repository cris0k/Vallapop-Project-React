# 'Vallapop' React Project

## Description

This project is a single-page application built with React from scratch. It uses an API REST to show adverts posted by users that are ether selling or looking for a certain product.

## What will you need?

First, clone the project's repository, which is our front-end:

```
git clone https://github.com/cris0k/Vallapop-Project-React
```
Then, open a new empty window in your editor and clone the repository that will be used as our backend:

```
git clone https://github.com/davidjj76/nodepop-api
```
Ones both are cloned, install all the dependencies with:

```
npm i
```

## Instuctions to run the website

Now that everything is set, run `nodepop-api` and `Nodepop-react` with:

```
npm start
```
On the `nodeppop-api`'s console you will be provided with a `swagger` link where you will need to register and get the credentials to be able to log in into the app.

Here is what you should expect to see one you logged in:
